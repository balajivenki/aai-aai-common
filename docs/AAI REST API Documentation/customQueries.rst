====================
 AAI Custom Queries
====================

Overview
========

Before You Start!
-----------------

It's important that you engage the AAI team before using these
queries. We're are actively evolving our schema, queries, and other
things in AAI. Queries and query parameters may change or be removed
in the future. It's important that, at the very least, we know who is
using which queries so we can be cautious of changes in the
future. And we can help you find the best way to get the data you
need.

Getting Started with the Custom Query API
-----------------------------------------

To execute a custom query, a client will perform a PUT on the query
API and include a payload indicating the starting node and the query
to be run. While the example below is for v11, this can be called in
any version v11 or higher. The version dictates which release's REST
API version the output will be based on.

API URI
=======

.. code::

   PUT /aai/v$/query?format={format}

When calling the query API, the client must specify the output format
as a query string. The currently available output formats are below,
along with examples.


count
-----

Provides an count of the objects returned in the query.

.. code::

   PUT /aai/v$/query?format=count

Example reponse

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "results": [
       {
	 "pnf": 4,
	 "p-interface": 5,
	 "l-interface": 3,
	 "pserver": 1
       }
     ]
   }

id 
--- 

Provides an array of objects containing resource-type (AAI's node
type; i.e., pnf) and a URI using the vertex ID from AAI's graph.

.. code::

   PUT /aai/v$/query?format=id

Example Response
   
.. code-block:: json

   {
     "results": [
       {
	 "resource-type": "complex",
	 "resource-link": "/aai/v1/resources/id/8159312"
       },
       {
	 "resource-type": "complex",
	 "resource-link": "/aai/v1/resources/id/389256"
       }
     ]
   }

pathed
------

Provides an array of objects containing resource-type (AAIs node type;
i.e., pnf) and a URI using the AAI REST API pathed URIs

.. code::

   PUT /aai/v$/query?format=pathed

Example Response
   
.. code-block:: json

   {
     "results": [
       {
	 "resource-type": "complex",
	 "resource-link": "/aai/v1/cloud-infrastructure/complexes/complex/complex1"
       },
       {
	 "resource-type": "complex",
	 "resource-link": "/aai/v1/cloud-infrastructure/complexes/complex/complex1"
       }
     ]
   }

resource
--------

Provides each object in the results array in the same format as AAI's
REST API with depth = 1 (first level children and cousin
relationships).

   }

Optional Query Parameters
-------------------------

depth
~~~~~

You can pass the depth query parameter to specify how many levels of
children/grandchildren to return. The default depth is 1.

.. code::
  
   PUT /aai/v$/query?format={resource OR resource_and_url}}&depth=0

nodesOnly
~~~~~~~~~

You can pass the nodesOnly query parameter to have the output only
contain the object properties with no relationships.

.. code:: 

   PUT /aai/v$/query?format={format}&nodesOnly=true

subgraph
~~~~~~~~

You can pass a subgraph query parameter that determines the behavior
of the output.  Using subgraph=prune returns all of the objects from
the query and only the edges between those objects. Using
subgraph=star returns all of the objects from the query plus all of
the objects they relate to.

The default is subgraph=star

.. code::

   PUT /aai/v$/query?format={format}&subgraph={subgraph}

Payload
-------

Typically the query payload will include both a "start" and a "query"
portion. The "start" can indicate one or more starting nodes in the
graph. If multiple nodes are specified, the result will contain the
query results for all of the start nodes. The "query" indicates the
name of the query to be run and also takes query parameters depending
on the query. Please reference the page for each specific saved query
for how it should be used, but keep in mind that any URI can be used
in the start parameter as long as it provides the same object
types. **Note: The start URI must adhere to standard percent-encoding
rules to properly account for special characters.**

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "start" : ["{namespace}/{resource}"],
     "query" : "query/{query-name}"
   }

There also the option to pass a "start" to the query API with no
specified query. This will return the input node(s) in the format
requested.

.. code-block:: json

   {
       "start" : ["{namespace}/{resource}"]
   }

Switching to Custom Query from Named Query
==========================================

You can find the custom query intended to replace the named query you
are using by searching this page (ctrl + f) for either the named query
name or the named query uuid. Suggested query parameters to use to
receive output in the closest format to the named query output are
also provided.
